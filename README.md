# UFred Coding Challenge [Frontend Mock Implementation]

## Introduction
   - A mockup design was supplied of a user interface.
   - The task is to bring the design to life using only HTML5, CSS and any Javascript (no rapid development tools).
   - A rollover or gallery is needed and the site needs to be responsive.
   
## Installation
   - Download or clone the repo
   - Open index.html
   
## Noticible Problems
   - The implementation is responsive but not mobile friendly, since making it mobile friendly would require additional design resources.

## Additional Comments
- Pretty straight forward challenge overall, no significant obstacles encountered.
- A total of *three hours* of planning and implementing. 
- *One hour* for source control and documenting.
